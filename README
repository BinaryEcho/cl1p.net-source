cl1p.net was written in Java. This ment some hefty hosting fees as Java needs a ton of memory. I have attempted to re-write cl1p.net a number of times but have never had the time to complete them.



./php/ This is an old rewrite of cl1p.net for PHP, it is incomplete and I'm not sure if it works at all. But a good starting point for php devs.

./python-appengine/ Most sucesfull rewrite. Basic functions work.

./java/ The current code for cl1p.net. Requires java 1.6, Apache Ant and Apache Tomcat, and a MySql database. 
Once configured with the right properties file it will connect to the database and it should create the tables and be
ready to run. To build and -f ant.xml build.war
